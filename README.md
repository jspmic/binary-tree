# binary-tree
A simple implementation of a binary tree and some algorithms concerning binary trees.
This repo contains:
    - Functions to calculate the height and size of a binary tree(using recursion)
    - Functions to traverse the tree using DFS and BFS(using recursion except for BFS)

Keep in mind that the implementation of the binary tree is not the main subject of this repo.
This repo is here simply to give an idea of what DFS and BFS are(i will post iterative implementations in the future). If you know too much about trees, this repo is not for you.
